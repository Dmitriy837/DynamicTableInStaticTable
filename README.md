# DynamicTableInStaticTable
An example of how UITableViewController can be used with static cells to keep simple references to static outlets  even if some part of it must be changable dynamically.
To make things evem more complicated dynamic cells can not only be added, but also rearranged with [BVReorderTableView](https://github.com/bvogelzang/BVReorderTableView).
And another bit of complication: we want to have some view at the bottom of the screen, which doesn't move as table scrolls, but can do something with table's content.
